## Introduction

### Boundary Element MATLAB code. Modelling faults and deformation

This software is for academic use. Do not use this in a commercial environment. There are plenty of commercial Boundary Element codes in circulation. 
It does not require compiling, simply run the script 'AddFilePaths.m' then load the file 'Mainframe.m' in MATLAB (either from the 3D or 2D directory) then start the code by pressing the &#9654; (run) symbol in the editor tab of MATLAB, alternatively call "run MainFrame.m" in the cmd window. Once the code starts it should run spitting out diagrams, showing progressbars and supplying results. 

This code uses the Boundary Element Method (BEM), specifically the Displacement Discontinuity Method (DDM).
Only fault surfaces or closed contours of bodies need to be digitised with boundary conditions placed on these elements. 
This assumes:
The material is isotropic, a linear elastic and that infinitesimal deformation applies.

When calculating an unknown such as slip due a prescribed stress the method is dependent on sampling of the surfaces. Users must increase sampling until they are satisfied the result is static or has a changes in precision that are acceptable. This can be seen clearly changing the sampling of surfaces or lines in the regression tests. 

This code was created in windows MATLAB versions:

2015a:2016b:2017a
 
It’s also been tested in Octave GUI windows versions:

4.0.0:4.0.3

although there are sometimes 'bugs' in the Octave Windows version it tends to run fine. It tends to fail in certain places, such as dealing with strings and drawing transparent objects so slight modifications may be required. 

It has also been run on both on Linux and Mac versions of MATLAB (2016b) and works fine. For these versions errors may exist when loading the file paths in newer scripts not tested on these platforms i.e \ /. 

I have tried to comment lines as much as possible. References to 'Pollard' are :'Pollard, D.D. and Fletcher, R.C., 2005. Fundamentals of structural geology. Cambridge University Press.'

I have attempted to keep copy-write tags on files from other places. If you spot somewhere I have missed this please email ASAP so I can fix this. Places where I was unsure if I could use such files a info.txt has been left with a link to the file download location. Download the files and place these in the file containing 'info.txt'.

## 1. How to run
[Index ^](#cutanddisplace)

Codes for 2D and 3D are laid out in the same manner. 
To run:
* Download the file from GitHub
* Unzip the folder and move it to the directory you would like to work from
* If you rename the folder make sure the new name still contains: 'CutAndDisplace'
* Open MATLAB
* Run the file inside the folder called ‘AddFilePaths.m’
* Then run using and editing 'MainFrame.m' in the respective 2D or 3D directory

## 2. Analytical tests

The code has analytical regression tests built in to test changes have not introduced bugs before a commit.
Note that all images below have been created directly using the software and are drawn like this when the regression tests run.

## 3. Files and data format
[Index ^](#cutanddisplace)

Formats that the code uses:

### 3.1. 2D files and data

The 2D code uses line data, each straight segment of a line is used as an element. 
These can be imported as:
Shape files(.shp) with multiple lines
or alternatively you can define lines your self. 

### 3.2. 3D files and data

The 3D code uses triangulated surfaces, each triangle then acts as an element (see gif above). 
These can be imported using these file types:
Stl (.stl) : only the non binary format, option available as export from the OS Meshlab software. http://meshlab.sourceforge.net/
gocad ascii (.ts) : a common format in geological software. Easy to read the text files. 
You could attempt to make 3D surfaces yourself if you have lots of time. 

Once these are defined in Step 1 then the user can continue. 

### 3.3. Code structure
[Index ^](#cutanddisplace)

The code is run using the files 'Mainframe'. This is a list of steps that call functions as they go, these give an indication of how to use the software. If you put a breakpoint at the beginning of each step you should be able to slowly work your way through the code and work out how it works. The steps are summarised below:

*   Step 1. Import the line/surface, defining the boundary and what it represents (i.e. locked elements, interfaces) for the boundary element model. Importing from file or defining directly.

*   Step 2. Define fullspace/halfspace and elastic constants of the material. This goes on to create the necessary data structure for you.  

*   Step 3. Define boundary conditions on elements, displacement, stress or traction at element centres, friction etc. This then calculates the slip due to these conditions and draws slip distributions or allows you to animate this as shown in the gif above. 

*   Step 4. Define observation points in the elastic medium. Defining points at which you would like to evaluate stress and displacement (or secondary fault surfaces to look at Coulomb stress change on faces). 

*   Step 5. Calculate stress and displacement at the observation points.

*   Step 6. Compute error on observation points due to the infinitesimal strain assumption.

*   Step 7. Visualise and analyse stress at the observation points, draw coulomb stress change, principal stresses, distortion maps, iso-contours etc. 

Its recommended that you look in the analytical test directories for more information on setting up complex problems.
