%Conventions:
%
% This follows the same unit convention as Poly3d so ''assumes
% dimensionally consistent units for physical quantities with
% dimensions of length or stress. Thus if you use kilometers for any
% quantity with dimensions of length (e.g. a coordinate position), you
% must use kilometers for all quantities with dimensions of length
% (e.g. displacement discontinuity).'' Andrew Lyell Thomas, Masters
% thesis, Stanford University.
%
% Engineering stress convention is used in this script for both tensors
% and principal stresses. S1 is the LEAST compressive stress. 
% See figure 6.13 & 6.14 in Pollard and Fletcher 2005.
